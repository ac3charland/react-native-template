# react-native-template

This repo was copied over from the first setup steps of another app. It's meant to capture an expo-created react-native app but with as little setup as necessary to run & do unit & e2e tests. A few caveats before this can be implemented:

- Need to write steps for copying this repo for a new project.
- Need to replace instances of name of old app (ear-trainer) with template or some such
- The Android app build fails every time and for the life of me I can't get it to change. This will need to be fixed, but hopefully this minimalist template will make diagnosing the problem easier.
